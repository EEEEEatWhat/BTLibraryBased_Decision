# BehaviorTree.ROS2

This repository contains useful wrappers to use ROS2 and BehaviorTree.CPP together.

In particular, it provides a standard way to implement:

- Action clients.
- Service Clients.
- Topic Subscribers.
- Topic Publishers.

Our main goals are:

- to minimize the amount of bolierplate.
- to make asynchonous Actions non-blocking.

Note that this library is compatible **only** with:

- **BT.CPP** 4.1 or newer.
- **ROS2** Humble or newer.

Additionally, check **plugins.hpp** to see how to learn how to
wrap your Nodes into plugins that can be loaded at run-time.
